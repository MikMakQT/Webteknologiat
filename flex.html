            <h1>TALLY HO GENTS!</h1>
            <p>Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into
                my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole
                through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely
                because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top
                of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the
                sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He
                Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.
                Just as the founding fathers intended.
